Welcome to my ETF materials! This organization is a collection of my academic materials from the courses I've taken at the Electrical Engineering Faculty of Sarajevo. 

## About

I created this organization to keep all my coursework in one place and to make it easier for myself and others to find and access my academic materials. Each repository represents a different course, with all the materials, projects, and assignments related to that course stored in the repository.

## How to Use

To access the materials for a particular course, simply navigate to the corresponding repository. From there, you can view or download the repository to your local machine and access all the files related to that course.

## Contributions

While this organization is primarily for my personal use, contributions and suggestions are always welcome! If you notice an error, have a suggestion for improvement, or would like to add your own materials to a particular course, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.

## Contact

If you have any questions or comments about this organization or my academic materials, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. You can contact me via email at [hmahmutovi3@etf.unsa.ba](mailto:hmahmutovi3@etf.unsa.ba?subject=Question%20regarding%20My%20ETF%20Materials%20Collection).
